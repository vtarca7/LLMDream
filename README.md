## LLMgeneratedCode 
This folder contains R & Python code that was generated by the LLMs tested in the study by Sarwal et al. (2025)

The outputs folder contains the run logs for each LLM, for both R and Python

The filename convention is [LLM Name]-[Endpoint Number].[R/Python]

Endpoint #1: Predict gestational age from gene expression in blood)
Endpoint #2: Predict preterm birth from microbiome data
Endpoint #3: Predict early preterm birth from microbiome data
Endpoint #4: Predict gestational age from methylation data

The filename convention is [LLM Name]-[DataChallengeIdentifier].[R/Python].pdf

DataChallenge #1: Predict gestational age from gene expression in blood)
DataChallenge #2A: Predict preterm birth from microbiome data
DataChallenge #2B: Predict early preterm birth from microbiome data
DataChallenge #3: Predict gestational age from methylation data
Note: Some LLMs combined the figures for 2A and B in a single file.
