# LLMDream

## LLMgeneratedCode 
This folder contains R & Python code that was generated by the LLMs tested in the study by Sarwal et al. (2025)

The filename convention is [LLM Name]-[Endpoint Number].[R/Python]

Endpoint #1: Predict gestational age from gene expression in blood)
Endpoint #2: Predict preterm birth from microbiome data
Endpoint #3: Predict early preterm birth from microbiome data
Endpoint #4: Predict gestational age from methylation data

## Outputs
The outputs folder contains the run logs for each LLM, for both R and Python
Same naming convention as for folder LLMgeneratedCode.

## LLMGeneratedPlots
This folder contains LLM outputed plots corresponding to the logs in the folder Outputs.
The filename convention is [LLM Name]-[DataChallengeIdentifier].[R/Python].pdf

DataChallenge #1: Predict gestational age from gene expression in blood)
DataChallenge #2A: Predict preterm birth from microbiome data
DataChallenge #2B: Predict early preterm birth from microbiome data
DataChallenge #3: Predict gestational age from methylation data
Note: Some LLMs combined the figures for 2A and B in a single file.

## o3_mini_high_Reproducibility
R & Python code and comments generated by o3_mini_high for the same prompts listed in table 1 of the manuscript.
The file name convention is: 
p(DataChallengeIdentifier)(Language)_t(trial number).txt
Tasks are: 
1-Gestational age prediction from blood transcriptomics;
2-Gestational age prediction from placenta DNA methylation
3-Pprediction of preterm birth (A) or early preterm birth (B) from methylation data
